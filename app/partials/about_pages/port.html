        <p>The Port of San Francisco is governed by a five member Board of Commissioners, each of whom is appointed by the Mayor and subject to confirmation by the City's Board of Supervisors. Each commissioner is appointed to a four-year term. The Port Commission is responsible for the seven and one-half miles of San Francisco Waterfront adjacent to San Francisco Bay, which the Port develops, markets, leases, administers, manages, and maintains. Its jurisdiction stretches along the waterfront from Hyde Street Pier on the north to India Basin on the south. The Port's operating portfolio is composed of over 550 ground, commercial, retail, office, industrial and maritime industrial leases, including many internationally recognized landmarks such as Fisherman's Wharf, PIER 39, the Ferry Building, and AT&T Park, home of the San Francisco Giants baseball team.</p>

        <p>James R. Herman was first appointed to the San Francisco Port Commission by Mayor Dianne Feinstein in 1982 where he served three consecutive terms. In 1996, he was again appointed to the commission by Mayor Willie L. Brown, Jr. He was a strong advocate for maritime business at the Port. In his final term as commissioner, he was instrumental in laying the groundwork of a plan that, today, is re-establishing the Port of San Francisco as an international maritime presence.</p>
