The International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) was founded following a major 1934 West Coast waterfront strike and is headquartered in San Francisco.  The original core group of workers loaded and unloaded ships’ cargo by hand using strength, skill, and ingenuity. The term "longshoreman" originated in the early days. When a ship approached shore, the captain, seeking extra hands to work cargo, beckoned to those in need of jobs, yelling "men along the shore." Today, the ILWU represents over 40,000 workers who belong to 60 local unions and divisions located along the U.S. West Coast, plus Hawaii, Panama and Canada. Almost 20,000 dockworkers continue to work on the waterfront at twenty-nine West Coast ports. Other ILWU members are employed in a wide variety of other industries, including hotels and tourism, industrial and warehousing, mining, agriculture, maritime, and retail.
