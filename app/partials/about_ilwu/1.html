A firm commitment to union democracy and membership participation has been the hallmark of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union since its beginning in the 1930s.  This is nearly unique in U.S. economic and industrial life.  In the ILWU, any member can speak at a union meeting and potentially influence overall ILWU policy. Explaining the union’s strength and its ability to command a dedicated following, Harry Bridges, the ILWU’s founding International President, said, "It was about democracy. We said that the rank and file had the right to decide, and if you gave them the facts, they’d make the right decision."
