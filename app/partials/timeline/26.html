Over the years, the Port of San Francisco has demonstrated its respect by honoring Jimmy’s long service to the port and the community.  In 1994, the port awarded Jimmy the prestigious Maritime Order of Merit with the rank of Commander.  During 2014, the port dedicated the new cruise ship terminal in Jimmy’s honor.  It is the only terminal of its kind named after a U.S. union leader.
