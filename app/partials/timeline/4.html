The 1934, a great Pacific Coast maritime strike shut down shipping at ports throughout the western United States.  Longshoremen struck in May to protest degrading and discriminatory hiring practices and to call for more humane working conditions. Other marine workers soon joined their ranks.  In July, police shot and killed two San Francisco strike supporters. Many more were injured that “Bloody Thursday.” Following the two deaths, labor unions galvanized to shut down the city of San Francisco in what is known as a “general strike” that rocked the nation.  In the arbitration that followed, the union was awarded most of its demands, including a union-controlled hiring hall and a labor contract that extended to all ports along the coast to ensure worker solidarity.
