In the 1970s and 1980s, Bay Area longshore workers organized several boycotts to protest US support of repressive regimes in Central and South America.  In opposition to government-sanctioned death squads in El Salvador, longshoremen refused to load military cargo headed to that country or to unload Salvadoran coffee.  They also refused to handle bomb parts headed to Chile to aid the military junta there. Jimmy was vocal in lending union aid for these international causes.
