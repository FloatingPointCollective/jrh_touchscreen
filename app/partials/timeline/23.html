In the 1970s and 1980s, International Longshore and Warehouse Union members organized several boycotts to protest U.S. support of repressive regimes in Central and South America.  In opposition to the Salvadoran governmentâ€™s death squads, longshore workers refused to load military cargo headed to that country or to unload Salvadoran coffee.  They also refused to handle bomb parts headed to Chile to aid the military junta there. Jimmy was vocal in lending union aid for these international causes.
