After the war, Jimmy worked as a steward on the Matson Lurline luxury ocean liner on cruises between San Francisco and Honolulu. In 1946, while the Lurline was docked in Honolulu, Jimmy led a walkout of the shipâ€™s crew in solidarity with 25,000 striking International Longshore and Warehouse Union sugar workers seeking economic justice and strengthened union recognition. The Lurline sat in port for six months. Ultimately, the union won the sugar strike.  Jimmy moved to San Francisco a year after the walkout.
