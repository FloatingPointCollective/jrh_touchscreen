In 1991, Jimmy retired from the International Longshore and Warehouse Union.  Reflecting on his years of service to Labor, Jimmy said,  “It’s been a good life.  And you don’t measure the good life by whether you made $200,000 a year and had a lear jet.  You measure the good life by what little you’re able to do together with your friends and your brothers and your sisters.  You measure it by how successfully you’ve been able to use the strength of the union against the slaughter of people, be they Jesuit priests in El Salvador or poor children in Bangladesh.  To keep this union strong, united, and committed to all of the decent propositions that we live and die by. Thank you very much.  It’s been great working with all of you.
