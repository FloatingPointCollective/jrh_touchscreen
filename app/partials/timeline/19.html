In 1977, Jimmy succeeded Harry Bridges as International Longshore and Warehouse Union International President. Bridges was a key leader of the 1934 Pacific Coast maritime strike and the ILWU’s founding president. Jimmy was an extraordinary and dynamic leader in the tradition of Bridges.  One observer wrote, “Jimmy’s mastery of the economics of the maritime industry and his command of parliamentary procedure made him the only human being who could successfully fill Bridges’ shoes.”
