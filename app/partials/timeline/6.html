Jimmy was a voracious reader all his life, and prided himself on his self-taught education. He used his time in the Merchant Marine to read everything he could. Karl Marx was especially influential. He reminisced later that “[Sailing was a lonely life] but it provided the opportunity to read an extraordinary amount about history, the classics, the great events in time. And you learned just by listening. A great deal of wisdom resided in those ships.”
