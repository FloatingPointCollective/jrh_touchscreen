At the height of McCarthyism in the early 1950s, an anti-communist Coast Guard screening program forced Jimmy to leave the merchant marine.  The program victimized union activists as well as suspected political radicals.  No longer able to work aboard ships, Jimmy joined warehouse Local 6, International Longshore and Warehouse Union, and found work in storage and distribution facilities along San Francisco’s waterfront.
