Jimmy grew up in a time when “get a job, join a union” was the motto for most workers in America. Jimmy said his road to leadership “emerged from the working life of the union. It’s not something you plan for like a doctor or a lawyer, but is accidental. You don’t prepare, you simply find yourself in a situation that is unbelievably democratic, where everyone has license to advocate any point of view. You learn to survive amid extraordinary dissent, and you learn to be careful in your judgment of the license you have.”
