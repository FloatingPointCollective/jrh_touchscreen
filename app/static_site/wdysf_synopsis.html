                        <div>Herman devoted his life to improving the situation of working people everywhere. His labor activism began when he joined the Marine Cooks and Stewards Union, which advocated to increase the wages for "low-level" jobs, such as cooking and cleaning, on luxury ocean liners. After settling in San Francisco in 1947, he spent the rest of his life fighting for fair wages and  benefits for his fellow ILWU constituents, as well as for members of other unions and working people worldwide.</div>
