          <h1>About the ILWU</h1>
          <div class="copy">
          	<p>The International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) was founded following a major 1934 West Coast waterfront strike and is headquartered in San Francisco.</p>
 
      			<p>Today, the ILWU represents over 40,000 workers who belong to 60 local unions and divisions located along the U.S. West Coast, plus Hawaii, Panama and Canada. Almost 20,000 longshore workers continue to work on the waterfront at twenty-nine West Coast ports. Other ILWU members are employed in a wide variety of other industries, including hotels and tourism, industrial and warehousing, mining, agriculture, maritime, and retail.</p>
       
      			<p>The ILWU remains dedicated to helping workers achieve justice and respect.  The union is still guided by "Ten Principles" established over decades of difficult struggle which include the importance of democratic decision-making, membership involvement, respect for different points of view, and the belief that "an injury to one is an injury to all."</p>
